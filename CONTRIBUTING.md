# When submitting a PR, please remember to:
* **Test your code** if it works properly without any issues (if you can't and the PR is small, then you don't have to)
* **COMMENT complicated** or harder to read **code** ex. what this algorithm does?
* **AVOID formatting existing code** (it's harder for me to review your changes!)
* **NOT include ANY** bits of **stolen code**, also includes **AI generated code**
* **NOT include irrevelant changes**

# If you're a reviewing a PR:
* **Test the changes** that you're reviewing
* **Stay civil** to other people!
